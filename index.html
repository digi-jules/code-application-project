                        <p>The idea for OTWYFS was born while I was browsing my notes app and rediscovered a
                            meaningful list from the past, titled "open this when you're feeling sad..." The note
                            includes a list of people I love, positive affirmations, reasons to live, etc., and it was
                            written during a dark period of my life as a way to remind myself that I was not alone and
                            things will get better. This list was my lifeline at times, especially when I felt my mental
                            health was heading into
                            a downwards spiral.<br><br>I think many others could benefit from the concept of having a
                            personalized list of ways to cope with their struggles, and I now hope to one day have the
                            resources to make the development of this app a reality.</p>
